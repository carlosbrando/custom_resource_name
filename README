CustomResourceName
==================

This is a plugin that would add an option :as to map.resources.

This would help in creating customised URL's irrespective of what the resources were called.

For e.g. if I want to keep my resources in English, but the URLs to talk portuguese, then:

    
  map.resources :products, :as => 'produtos' do |product|
    product.resources :product_reviews, :as => 'comentarios'
  end 
  map.resources :posts, :as => 'artigos' do |tutor|
    product.resources :post_reviews, :as => 'comentarios'
  end 

These will yield paths like the following:

  produtos/:product_id/comentarios
  artigos/:tutor_id/comentarios
