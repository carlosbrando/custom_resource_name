Custom Resource Name
==================

The Custom Resource Name Plugin lets you add alias for your routes. This is very useful if you are developing a software to a country that does not speak English and wants all URLs in the native language.

To install the plugin is very simple:

./script/plugin install http://plugins.nomedojogo.com/custom_resource_name

To use it is simpler yet. Open the file routes.rb of your project and include the following lines BEFORE the routes that should be translated:

# translate resources
map.aliases :resources, :posts => ‘artigos‘, :comments => ‘comentarios‘

# translate actions
map.aliases :actions, :new => ‘novo‘, :edit => ‘editar‘, :logout => ‘sair‘

If you have any english route that should stay untouched, put it before the aliases definition.

Ready!

You can add aliases for all its resources and actions.

If this plugin is interesting to you, be sure to recommend me on Working with Rails.
