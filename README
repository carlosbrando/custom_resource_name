Custom Resource Name
====================

The Custom Resource Name Plugin lets you add aliases for your routes. This is very useful if you are developing a software to a country that does not speak English and wants all URLs in the native language.

To install the plugin is very simple. The plugin is on the GitHub. If you have Git installed, take the plugin using the command:

git clone git://github.com/carlosbrando/custom_resource_name.git custom_resource_name

If you don’t use Git (should…) you can download the plugin and then copy the files into the folder vendor/plugins of your project.
To download: http://github.com/carlosbrando/custom_resource_name/tarball/master

To use it is simpler yet. Open the file routes.rb of your project and include the following lines BEFORE the routes that should be translated:

# translate resources
map.aliases :resources, :posts => ‘artigos‘, :comments => ‘comentarios‘

# translate actions
map.aliases :actions, :new => ‘novo‘, :edit => ‘editar‘, :logout => ‘sair‘

# translate namespaces
map.aliases :namespaces, :admin => ‘administrativo‘

If you have any english route that should stay untouched, put it before the aliases definition.

Ready!

You can add aliases for all its resources and actions.
